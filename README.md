# Curriculum Vitae Django Project

## Overview

_My very own professional website which I can customize at my whim._

__Tech Stack__: Django, Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Secrets Manager), PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

This is my CV website. For my portfolio, visit https://marvintensuan.github.io.

## Django on Cloud Run

Initial build for this website is heavily guided by [__this Google codelab__](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-run-django/). Anyone who would follow instructions in this codelab should be able to build a working Django project with a default landing page.

I have modified the project with the help of [__Coding For Entrepreneur__'s Django Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5mRW0jo-U4) as well as the of [__Official Django docs__](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/).
